Hey, I'm Henrique. I started my journey in coding and software in 2022, building websites for fun. 

Currently, I'm looking for my first opportunity to be a full-time software engineer and help companies build cool and important projects. 

I'm a country boy living in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil and now working as a **Support Engineer**. 

I love personal projects, APIs, databases, and watching camping videos on YouTube, and in my free time, I love to run, lift heavy weights, and have fun with friends.

## Let's talk?

It will be a great pleasure to meet you and talk about life, software and opportunities while drinking a good cup of coffee â˜•.
