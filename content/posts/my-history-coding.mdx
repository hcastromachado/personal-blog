## My history with computers

Computers always fascinated me. Really. 

I remember when I was a kid and my aunt bought her first computer. It was a Windows 7 and, for the first time, my eyes shone for that thing. I used to play a lot of games, using Orkut and Messenger ‚Äî RIP ‚ö∞Ô∏è.

So many incredible memories and my first contact can't be so much better. 

I never thought I could use a computer to build things that other people use. Often, I thought it was just for fun, messaging, watching videos, or work and only realized that I could do more when I got my first job that I needed to use a computer every day. 

This discovery was so important that I started to enjoy more and more using. 

After this, I watched a ton of videos on YouTube on how I could my computer better, like: 

1.  How to use a terminal on Windows with basic commands. 
2.  Automating boring tasks with apps that I discovered on the internet
3.  And finally, how to build a website

When I wrote my first line of `Hello World` in HTML, I was feeling like a hacker ‚Äî quite a Mr. Robot and it amazed me because when I saw that thing I wrote on a terminal, I started thinking "Ok! That's incredible. But how can I make more interesting things like adding colors or changing fonts."


The Internet has changed everything in our lives and if you want to know how to code, sell things, or just learn something you think it is cool, you have a place for it. 

Developers and people often are trying to buy more and more courses to learn, but everything we need to start is available on the Internet. Just find in Google, YouTube, and StackOverflow (if you code, you have been there, don't lie to me. üòÑ)

This is a great time to live. 

## My experiences working with Technology

 Until now, I never worked as a developer, but I used every opportunity in my career to learn from others and looking for people who actually is smarter than I am. It pushes me a lot on my goals. 

 Working as a Support Engineer has a lot of challenges, but beautiful experiences. The chance to learn directly from other people's problem make you improve a lot, because you're actually thinking on how to solve a real issue while having pressure to make it faster (üòÑ).

 Learning SQL was one of my best achievements in life. I can make things fast and if you guys want know on a hands-on course, go to YouTube and look for [freeCodeCamp,org](https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp) tutorials. 

## My advice to you (and for me)

This little history is just a start on how I'm building my journey in **software engineering.**

I'm not a software engineer yet, but looking and making everything I can to make this dream happen one day. 

I think opportunities will knock on our doors when we are preparing for them. 

Studying hard (and smart). Working hard. And sharing my knowledge with others, one day will guide me to work with something I enjoy. 

It will inspire you, even if you're not working as a software engineer like me, but you can't give up. 

A guy said this: "I believe in my ability to figure out new things." 

So, keep pushing, studying, and making everything at your sight to achieve your dreams as a **software engineer.**
